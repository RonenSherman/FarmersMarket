## 🚀 Quick Setup for Real Notifications

Currently, notifications are **simulated** and logged to the browser console. To enable real email and SMS notifications, follow these steps:

### 📧 **Email Notifications (SendGrid)**

1. **Sign up for SendGrid**: https://sendgrid.com/
2. **Get your API key**: 
   - Go to Settings → API Keys
   - Create a new API key with "Full Access"
3. **Add to environment**:
   ```env
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
   ```

### 📱 **SMS Notifications (Twilio)**

1. **Sign up for Twilio**: https://twilio.com/
2. **Get your credentials**:
   - Account SID and Auth Token from dashboard
   - Purchase a phone number from Twilio
3. **Add to environment**:
   ```env
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
   ```
